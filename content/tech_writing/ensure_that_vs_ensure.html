<div id="that-is-the-question" class="section level1">
<h1>“That” is the question!</h1>
<p>A prominent dilemma among writers is whether to use “<strong>ensure that</strong>”, or simply “<strong>ensure</strong>”. There is no consensus in the community about the inclusion of “<em>that</em>”, but the following discussion might shed some light.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples" class="section level1">
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Consider the following sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Before installation, <strong>ensure that</strong> the md5 signature matches with the original package.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Silly example does not <strong>ensure</strong> clarity.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In such use cases, “that” is an example of <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/relative-pronouns/"><code>relative pronouns</code></a>. At the same time, “that” also acts as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementizer"><code>complimentizer</code></a>, which is often used in a sense similar to conjunctions.</p>
<p>Ambiguous situations like this have no official correct answer. When faced with such confusion, trusting your educated instinct is the best bet. However, you can follow the rule of thumb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Use “<strong>ensure that</strong>” when there there is a <strong>verb/clause</strong> following it, and “<strong>ensure</strong>” when there is a <strong>noun</strong> following it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inclusion of relative pronouns and complimentizers such as “that” is quite subjective, and is best left to personal writing style, even in cases where “ensure” is followed by a verb/clause.</p>
<p>As an example, consider two versions of the same sentence:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>To <strong>ensure that</strong> writers comply with the best practices, editors must explain the reason behind suggested revisions.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>To <strong>ensure</strong> writers comply with the best practices, editors must explain the reason behind suggested revisions.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both are correct, due to lack of any concrete guideline. I personally prefer the version with “that”, as it is more explicit.</p>
<p>I am eager to listen to your opinion on this topic.</p>
