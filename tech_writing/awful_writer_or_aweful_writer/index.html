<h1>Before you read</h1>
<p>If you are reading this article, I assume that the majority of you must be technical writers. The peer-review checklist might be firmly etched in your mind. Please make sure this checklist in disabled. If doing so is not possible, just click the <strong>X</strong> sign at the top-right corner of the screen. Also, if you have no sense of humor, it is mandatory to click the <strong>X</strong> sign. I make no apologies for the grammatical errors or syntax errors or sentence structure or comma splices or… <em>whew..pant..pant…</em> this ‘or’ is making me breathless. In fact, I am thriving on these errors because my creative skills are running riot. I have expressed my thoughts in an unconventional manner and, believe me, the feeling is exhilarating and invigorating!</p>
</div>
<div id="ok-here-goes" class="section level1">
<h1>Ok here goes…</h1>
<p>I have a confession to make. I think I am <em>not</em> a good writer. Not really. I simply cannot pen down my ideas for long periods of time and neither does the light glow bright in my grey cells with many ideas like it does for some others. If at all I get a flash and write, it takes me unbearably long to put it all down. My thoughts do not flow like a running stream as that of some other writers. I also cannot seem to say what I mean to say and soon forget what I originally intended to convey. Now that is bad because I am a professional writer and the USP of the writer is the exact opposite.</p>
<p>So, now me, I confine myself to writing only about software. In other words, I am a <em>technical writer</em>. I seem to be doing okie-dokie (they gave me a good feedback). But often, I find technical documentation boring and get yawning fits every time I read “technical mumbo-jumbo”. What are my tasks? At times, all I do is create headings and paragraph styles, and align pictures. After that, I need to ensure that the file names are according to the standards, the documents are converted to portable format, and the correct version is stored properly. Now, does that not make being a technical writer a lot of hard work? We think about such things as Em dashes and squinting modifiers and figure citations, and make sure that the reader understands and benefits from what is written. (Stage whisper: I don’t see how these can be so important so long as a reader of ordinary intelligence understands what is written.)</p>
<p>But then, not everything about my job is difficult. What makes my tasks easy? I am bound by templates and copy-paste operations of documents that “technical people” have written. A spell-checker fine-tunes my writing. If there are errors, no one notices or if they do, they seem not to care - else what I write would have been ripped apart by the reviewers the way a dog does the rags. I do not have to worry too much as I work in a team and hurrah to the peer review process! And of course, I can loudly protest (in India, you have to be very noisy to be heard) that the technical team steam-rolled me into writing this way, that I cannot touch this or that because doing will change the technical meaning (you get the picture…) The verb–noun confusions and minimalism and parallel constructions principle can be buried in the protest that the document has to be technically consistent so as not to confuse the reader (method in madness). I can also argue that a perfect document is like mannequin - beautiful but useless. Readers want some variety and that we have to maintain their interest level. ( No No No. the last two statements are not true. Some mischievous elf in me made me write this - I am sorry! And that same elf will not allow me to delete the sentences.)</p>
<p>In addition, (I use this word instead of “additionally”), I wear a “TW uniform”. As writers, we have an image and an attitude to keep, right? During <em>“brainstorm meetings”</em>, I hold a pen (who cares whether the pen works or not) and a notepad, look suitably serious, and nod at regular intervals (which indicates I am concentrating - note the use of the word “indicates”). The glasses perched on my nose completes the serio-intelli effect. A fellow pseudo-technical writer (a full-fledged mentally-challenged writer with a Big company) once told me that you can easily get away by asking questions (in accented English) that the technical people would frown upon - evidently, the techies get an inferiority complex after listening to us talk eloquent words that make nonsense of their sensible, simple, and sweet English, and have them running for cover.</p>
<p>So, what does all this make me? An “awful writer” or an “awe”ful writer.</p>
